  A privacy policy is a document that outlines how an organization collects, uses, shares, and protects the personal information of individuals who interact with its services, websites, or apps. It serves as a legal statement that informs users about their privacy rights and how their personal information is handled by the organization. Here's an overview of the purpose and key components typically found in a privacy policy: </br> 
    <ol> 
      <li>
        <b>Transparency and Information Disclosure: </b> The primary purpose of a privacy policy is to provide clear and understandable information to individuals about the organization's data practices. It explains what types of personal information are collected, why they are collected, and how they are used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Consent and Control:  </b> A privacy policy explains how individuals can give their consent for the collection and processing of their personal information. It also outlines their rights and control over their data, including the ability to access, update, or delete their information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Collection and Usage:  </b> The policy describes the types of personal information collected, such as names, email addresses, or browsing history. It explains the purpose of data collection, whether it's for providing services, improving user experience, personalization, marketing, or legal compliance. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Sharing and Third Parties:  </b> If personal information is shared with third parties, the privacy policy discloses the parties involved, the purpose of sharing, and any safeguards in place to protect the data. It may also mention any data transfer to other countries and compliance with relevant data protection laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security Measures:  </b> The policy highlights the organization's efforts to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. It may include details about encryption, secure storage, access controls, and regular security assessments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:  </b> If the organization uses cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies to collect user data, the policy explains their purpose, the information they collect, and how users can manage their preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Children's Privacy:   </b> If the organization collects personal information from children, the policy addresses the special considerations and compliance with applicable child privacy laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Updates and Notification:  </b> The policy may include information about how changes to the privacy policy are communicated to users and when they come into effect.

  We are using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which provides a variety of features and services to ensure data security for its users. Here are some key aspects of data security in GCP:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Physical Security: </b>
      Google data centers are highly secure facilities with strict access controls, surveillance systems, and redundant power and cooling infrastructure. They are designed to protect against physical threats such as unauthorized access, natural disasters, and power outages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Encryption: </b>
      GCP offers encryption at rest and in transit. Data at rest is automatically encrypted by default using Google-managed encryption keys. Additionally, customers can use their own encryption keys with services like Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). Data in transit is encrypted using industry-standard protocols like HTTPS and TLS.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Identity and Access Management (IAM): </b>
      GCP provides IAM, which allows users to control access to their resources. IAM enables fine-grained permissions management, role-based access control, and the ability to grant least privilege access to users and service accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Network Security: </b>
      GCP has built-in network security controls to protect against unauthorized access and network attacks. This includes Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation, firewall rules, and Cloud Load Balancing for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Loss Prevention (DLP):  </b>
      GCP offers DLP capabilities to help identify and protect sensitive data. DLP features include scanning for personally identifiable information (PII), credit card numbers, and other sensitive data patterns. It allows for redaction, masking, or encryption of sensitive data to prevent data breaches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Security Center: </b>
      GCP Security Command Center provides centralized visibility into security-related data and offers security recommendations and best practices. It helps users monitor and improve the security posture of their GCP resources.
    </li>
